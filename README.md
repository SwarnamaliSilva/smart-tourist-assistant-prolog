This mini expert system is titled “Smart Tourist Assistant”. This system is designed for make easier for user to plan and choose a best travel destination based on that user preferences. This system can smartly recommend a best matching travel destination through region, user interest, budget level, season like that to find the best one for users.  

As the development environment, SWI-Prolog was used for testing, and executing the logic-based program, Notepad++ is used as the text editor for creating and editing the source files.  Prolog is used as the logical programming language.

A systematic collection of travel destination information was created using the prolog 
predicate, with each fact containing specifics about a destination, including the area, season, 
budget constraints, interests, mode of travel, and activities available. This facilitated effective 
querying and reasoning. The application starts with an engaging interface that requests user to 
input through the console. Certain details are sought from the user based on their preference.
The recommendation system is built using a set of prolog rules and predicates, which filters 
destinations by 4 recommended predicates. 
Then the matched travel destinations are displayed clearly, including the details such as, Destination name, and country, Duration in days, Mode of travel, and List of activities.
Destinations are grouped and structured by region and budget for ease of maintenance. Adding 
new destinations or modifying the existing entries can be done by simply appending or editing 
the destination facts in the source code.
